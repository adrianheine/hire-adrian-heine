  h2 Hello,
  p I’m Adrian Heine, and I’m a freelance software developer living in Berlin. In recent years, I focused on web development using !{linkTo(['Skills', 'JavaScript'])} and !{linkTo(['Skills', 'PHP'])}.
  p My style is inspired by functional programming. I like my code to be clean and non-repetitive. When doing JavaScript stuff, I tend to use !{linkTo(['Skills', 'jQuery'])} or !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Ender.js'])} (for client-side code) and !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Underscore.js'])} (client- and server-side). A typical !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Node.js'])} web application I write is based on !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Express'])} and !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Jade'])}. I would love to further explore full-stack frameworks like !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Derby.js'])} and !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Meteor'])} or front-end frameworks like Ember.js, Angular.js and Backbone.js.
  p I love free software. As part of my last full-time job, I became a core contributor to the popular wiki engine !{linkTo(['Skills', 'DokuWiki'])} and developed several plugins. Before that, in 2009, I wrote the library !{linkTo(['Examples', 'libomb'])} for the free and federated microblogging platform !{linkTo(['Skills', 'StatusNet'])}. I use and promote !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Debian'])}. My servers are self-administered, and I handle everything from !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Apache'])} or !{linkTo(['Skills', 'nginx'])} to !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Postfix'])} and !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Dovecot'])}.
  p I believe in open standards and protocols and hope for a federated future. Free knowledge is just as important to me: I contributed to the German !{linkTo(['Skills', 'Wikipedia'])} as an admin and author of honored articles.
  p If you have a great project and find yourself in need for a PHP or JavaScript developer – please !{linkTo(['Contact', ''], 'get in touch')}!
  p Have a nice day,
  p.closing Adrian Heine
